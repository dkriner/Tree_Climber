# Tree_Climber
This is a small 2D game built entirely in the Eclipse IDE. 
Players must traverse upwards on a downscrolling screen and avoid touching the bottom.
Powerups, points, and other items must be collected along the way. 
There are 5 levels with increasing difficulty. All aspects: programming, art, and audio were done by Darren Kriner
