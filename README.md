# Tree_Climber
This is a small 2D game built with libgdx. 
The original premise was that the player is an insect climbing the trunk of a tree trying to reach the top.
Along the way you must collect stamina tokens and points by detouring onto branches whilst being rushed by a vertically scrolling screen.
Players must traverse upwards avoid falling below the camera. There are 5 levels with increasing difficulty.

Open the .jar file to play the game.
